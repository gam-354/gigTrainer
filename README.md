# Hello!

Welcome to GigTrainer, an app that lets you retrieve
the most live-played songs from your favorite band/artist so that
you can get ready to enjoy them in the next concert

## Requirements

In order to run GigTrainer, a couple of things must be set up

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
